                  The intellectual property in the materials contained in this
                  website are owned by or licensed to Questfully and are

                </LegalParagraph>
                <LegalParagraph>
                  This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of
                  title. This license shall automatically terminate if you
                  violate any of these restrictions or the Terms of Service, and
                  may be terminated by Questfully at any time.

                  Our website and the materials on our website are provided on
                  an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Questfully
                  makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and
                  hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including,
                  without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
                  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
                  non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation
                  of rights.
                </LegalParagraph>
                <LegalParagraph>
                  In no event shall Questfully or its suppliers be liable
                  for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any
                  third party arising from the use or inability to use this
                  website or the materials on this website, even if Questfully
                  or an authorized representative has been notified,
                  orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.
                </LegalParagraph>
                <LegalParagraph>
                  In the context of this agreement, "consequential loss"
                  includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or
                  anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue,
                  loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss
                  of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or
                  corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity,
                  tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.
                </LegalParagraph>
                <LegalParagraph>
                  Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                  warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
                  incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
